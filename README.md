The PDM_Fleet_monthly_refresh Notebook serves as a monthly processing and data refresh task focused on maintaining and updating fleet-related data. Here’s a breakdown of its purpose and functionality in business terms:

1. Monthly Data Aggregation and Preparation
Each month, the notebook aggregates and prepares data specific to the fleet, which includes details like vehicle usage, availability, cost information, and other key metrics.
It integrates data from various internal and external sources, ensuring that the latest information is available for fleet analysis. This could involve data on vehicle usage patterns, maintenance schedules, and leasing or ownership costs.
2. Holiday and Working Day Adjustments
Using a holiday library, the notebook identifies non-working days and public holidays in specific countries.
This is important for accurate reporting and processing. For example, if data processing depends on business days (e.g., only updating certain records on working days), the notebook can adjust accordingly, helping to avoid delays or errors in reports and calculations.
3. Execution Trigger Based on Workday Conditions
The notebook determines which processing steps to execute based on the business day. It uses a parameter called run_sql_out to decide whether it’s the first, second, or third working day, or a non-working day.
This approach allows the notebook to handle different actions depending on the timing within the business month. For example:
First or Second Working Day: Standard data preparation, used by regular reports or daily dashboard updates.
Third Working Day: Special processing for additional data that may be required for compliance or month-end reporting, such as generating reports for external stakeholders or conducting more complex analyses.
Non-Working Day or Special Condition: Pauses or skips certain data operations, optimizing resources and ensuring that data isn’t processed redundantly or inaccurately.
4. Integration with Databricks
This notebook is configured to run on Databricks, a platform that enables large-scale data processing. Databricks connects directly to databases and data lakes, allowing the notebook to perform high-speed calculations and handle large datasets efficiently.
Libraries like tabulate, holidays, and mailjet_rest are added for various functionalities:
Tabulate: For creating clean tables and summaries of data, making it easier to review results.
Holidays: For identifying public holidays, used in determining working and non-working days.
Mailjet: For sending automated notifications or alerts based on the results of the notebook’s execution.
5. Error Monitoring and Alerting
If any issues arise during the notebook’s execution—such as data inconsistency, missing information, or system errors—an alert system automatically sends an email to designated team members.
These emails ensure prompt notification of errors so that any issues can be addressed quickly. The subject and content of the emails are tailored to the nature of the error, allowing the team to prioritize and respond efficiently.
6. Output for Other Downstream Processes
Once the data processing is completed, the notebook stores the updated data in a way that it can be accessed by other data pipelines or business intelligence tools.
This data is then available for further processes, like financial reporting, operational decision-making, and performance analysis of the fleet. It may also feed into dashboards and other visualizations used by stakeholders to monitor fleet performance.
7. Business Impact and Purpose
Overall, the PDM_Fleet_monthly_refresh notebook supports fleet management by ensuring that up-to-date, accurate, and actionable data is available on a monthly basis.
The notebook’s automated workflows reduce manual effort, improve data quality, and help ensure timely reporting and analytics, which can inform strategic decisions on fleet usage, maintenance, and investments.
This monthly refresh process is especially valuable for a business with large fleets, where even minor improvements in efficiency can lead to substantial cost savings and improved customer service.
